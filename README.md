# Collaborative License
A license for compensated creative work.

Projects which use the collaborative license:
* Identify a stream of revenue;
* Accept a liability along with collaborative work to be paid from the revenue stream;
* May accept investment in the form of loans with both principal and interest to be paid from the revenue stream;
* Relinquish any copyrights for work which has been compensated;
* Openly share any source materials for public collaboration and encourage derivative projects which accept the terms of the license; and
* Specify a form of governance to be used when making decisions concerning stakeholders of the project which clearly defines their rights and obligations.

_**NOTE**: This license is a work in progress and has **NOT** been reviewed by **ANY** legal professionals. Do **NOT** use this license other than under your own risk and for the purposes of experimentation._

# How the License Works
The collaborative license is part of a larger vision for a revenue sharing business model intended for use on consensus-based compute platforms such as RChain or Ethereum. While it isn't absolutely necessary to use a smart contracting system with the capability of sending and receiving value through code, it is a helpful framework to understand how the model works.

## The Revenue Stream
The license is intended for projects that require some form of payment for use of its products or services. As revenue is brought into the project it is distributed to those who hold liabilities against the project, for example, people who have provided work, or funding through loans, or other expenses. 
    
## Accept Work along with a Compensation Agreement
When collaborators do work which is accepted by the project (e.g. when accepting a pull request), then the project also accepts a change to its rules, coded in a smart contract, for how revenue is distributed. In the simplest case, a project might start with no liabilities but then accept some work with an agreement to pay X amount. The project's revenue contract would be modified to transfer 100% of revenue up to X amount. Of course, real projects are made from many contributions so the policies for how the revenue contracts may be modified are covered under the project's governance.

The project's policies for accepting a compensation agreement must be in line with the ethical argument of Dr. David Ellerman (ellerman.org), which, in summary, states that each of us are responsible for our actions. A just system will hold each of us accountable for both the positive and negative outcomes of our actions. When contributors to a project produce something of value, the project must accept a liability, an agreement to share in the proceeds of the organization. For projects with an established revenue stream, this payment could be immediate, or settled in a short time with near term revenue. For startup projects, the liability might remain for years and perhaps never be met because of a lack of revenue. For long term liabilities, the project should agree to the value of the work and also to terms for payment, including interest to be paid from potential future revenue. This contract may be transferrable, allowing a worker to sell their work to someone else.

An individual who collaborates with a project must also accept a portion of the risk of any potential liabilities of the project. Options for individual collaborators include but are not limited to forming an LLC and purchasing private insurance or, working with a project's governance to purchase liability insurance for all contributors.

## Accepting Loans
Parties can participate in the project by bringing capital in the form of a loan. The process for accepting a loan is similar to accepting a compensation agreement in that the revenue smart contracts are modified to include the payment terms of the loan. The proceeds of the loan are disbursed based on the project's governance policies. This might include payment of compensation, payment of expenses, purchasing of equipment, etc.

## Relinquishing Copyrights for Compensated Work
For work which has not yet been compensated, any project which would create a derived work (e.g. a fork) must agree to terms of collecting revenue and sharing that revenue with the source project until its liabilities are paid, by a combination of revenue from the source project and the derived project, up to the point of the fork. Once liabilities are paid, the project is made available similar to any other open source project and is free to be used. It is acceptable for a project to include changes to the revenue contracts when receiving revenue from customers (e.g. a 50% split between paying off the projects liabilities and accepting a new liability on behalf of the customer). This provides a way for early customers to share the cost of development with customers who come later.

## Sharing Source Materials
The goal of the license is to create a means for openly collaborative yet compensated work. The barriers for entry to collaborate on the project should be kept as low as possible with a goal of meeting the same ease of collaboration as is found with open source projects today. People who would like to take the project in a different direction should be free to, but they must work to come to a good faith agreement to generate revenue from their work to compensate any previous work they are building from.

## Project Governance
The project must clearly state the rights of all stakeholders and the process which project-related decisions are made. No specific forms of governance are required, but it is expected that effective forms of governance will emerge from the use of smart-contract-defined processes. At a minimum, the project must state policies and procedures for these events:
* The process for accepting work
* The process of accepting revenue and how it will be disbursed
* The policy and process for accepting loans (or not) and how the proceeds of the loan are disbursed
* The policy and process for negotiating revenue sharing agreements with derivative projects
* A statement of liability and potential risks associated with participating with the project
* A statement of applicable jurisdiction and other statements to meet any legal obligations

# Collaborating on this Project
**NOTE**: Any collaboration on this project (github.com/glenbraun/CollaborativeLicense) is done with the assumption of **NO COMPENSATION**. I hope to find funding for the project of defining the license and related smart contracts which support the business model and to use the license itself as the model for the project which defines the license. That is, that users of the license would pay a licensing fee which would provide a revenue stream to compensate contributors and investors of the license itself. However, no funding has been secured. So, if you collaborate on the project by filing issues in GitHub, discussing the project, or any other form of collaboration you should assume that your collaboration is done free of charge without any expectation of compensation, now or in the future.

# Cooperative Decentralized Organizations
Before mass and digital communications, it was natural to consider an organization as residing at a physical place like a farm, a shop, or a factory. People gathered there to work together to make a product or service to be offered at the market. Because of the organization's physical presence, the social conventions of physical property ownership were projected onto the organization. Those who owned the property rights to the land that was farmed, or the plot where the shop or factory sat, it was assumed, should not only command the operation of the work but should also determine how the proceeds be divided. We see this today in the nearly universal practice of owners setting a fixed price for labor in terms of an annual salary or hourly wage, with the remainder of the revenue, minus non-labor expenses, taken as profit.

Today, organizations exist which are mostly virtual, not tied to any physical location, and operate globally. What binds them together is a shared governance, an agreement to work together to produce something of value and to share the proceeds. An increasing number of these organizations are constructed primarily out of software, and these software defined, virtual companies provide an increasing number of services which are replacing their physically rooted counterparts. There are, for example, online marketplaces for short-term lodging which compete effectively with traditional hotels, or marketplaces for on-demand transportation replacing city taxi services.

As the value in organizations is captured within the combination of software code and the network of people who use it, it's natural to question if the projection of physical property rights is still a fitting metaphor. It becomes even more questionable when considering the new, decentralized compute platforms which are emerging. Consensus based compute platforms like Ethereum and RChain, running on a globally distributed network of compute nodes, provide a secure, public compute utility where not only is the computer hardware not owned, leased, or rented as they would be under traditional organizational structures but the code, component by component, can earn its own keep, if you will, by charging for its own execution.

These consensus-based compute platforms, due to the very high level of trust they establish, have changed the language that software developers use to describe their work, from the term "program" to "contract". These systems are in their very early stages of adoption but are already transacting $$ of value in simple value trade contracts. Innovative platforms using more expressive contracting languages, such as Rholang on the RChain platform, will enable the creation of organizations defined with an increasingly sophisticated, interdependent collection of computable contractual agreements. The scope of these contracts will quickly expand beyond simple financial transactions to include formally coded procedures for human processes like adding new workers, compensation, planning, etc. If you change the code, you'll change the organization. 

# Cooperative Governance - Accepting Work and Compensation
The following cooperative governance system is based on the concept of a COST (Communal Ownership Self-assessed Tax) for labor described in the book "Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society" by Eric A. Posner &amp; E. Glen Weyl. 

The governance system below describes a system where work is accepted into a cooperative project and at with what compensation. It divides work into two types, self-directed work, and directed work. One would assume that self-directed work would match nearly perfectly with an member's goals and interests since it is work they do based on their choice. Directed work is work done under subordination of someone else, as is typical of a regular job under a traditional employment contract. The compensation for self-directed work is set by the self-directed worker but is "taxed" by some amount of directed work required to receive that compensation. 

Certainly all directed work must be conducted within labor laws and meet ethical rules of conduct but it is assumed that there is some amount of sacrifice involved by the worker to subordinate themselves to perform work as specified by another cooperative member. Any organization that gets things done has some tasks which not everyone wants to do but which need to be done none-the-less. This work serves as a tax which supports the organization that provides a worker an opportunity to be compensated for their own creative, self-directed work.

To describe how the system works, the following terms are defined followed by descriptive scenarios which show them in action. The terms and scenarios are written from the perspective of using the system within the RChain cooperative, but would also apply to projects using the cooperative license.

## Terms of the Cooperative COST labor system
### Self-directed Work
This is work where the member is choosing their own tasks and is setting their own price. This work is compensated in RHOC but receipt of that compensation is dependent on the member completing an amount of Directed Work set and approved by a Compensation Panel. While performing Self-directed Work, the member has access to workers from the Directed Work Pool. Any active coop member can perform Self-directed Work on their own initiative. They do not need to use workers from the Directed Work Pool but they can. The compensation for Self-directed Work is set by the member though must be less than a maximum set by their participation within the system. There is no obligation for the coop to accept the terms of the Self-directed work but there will be patterns and norms which form that give guidance for the type of work commonly accepted and at what rates. The most important thing to understand about self-directed work is that it is only paid when a corresponding amount of directed work is completed. The ratio, or tax rate, of self-directed work to directed work is set by Compensation Panels informed by general guidance from the coop as a whole.
	 
### Directed Work
This is work where the member follows the direction of another member. A member can decline an invitation to participate in any particular Directed Work request but has an incentive to accept Directed Work because Self-directed Work is not paid until a corresponding Directed Work balance is completed. Directed work is counted in hours which must be accepted by a self-directed worker. Members maintain a calendar of when they are available for Directed Work. Directed Work which has been approved by a self-directed worker is always compensated. The rate of compensation is determined in combination with the self-directed worker and finally approved by a Compensation Panel. The coop maintains a minimum compensation rate which is the lowest hourly rate of pay for any Directed Work.
	 
### Directed Work Pool
This is a database of available Directed Work. Members maintain a profile of their work history and their skills. Self-directed workers can choose from the pool of directed work available to complete tasks based on a calendar which the directed worker maintains.
	 
### Compensation Panels
Compensation panels are dynamically assembled groups of coop members who review and pass judgement on Compensation Invoices. The panels are formed by selecting at least one board member and some number, perhaps two or four, members at random from the Directed Work Pool. These panels are formed to meet the demand of outstanding Compensation Invoices. Each panel uses a democratic process with Quadratic Voting to approve, reject, or amend Compensation Invoices. No member of a panel can review their own work.
	 
### Compensation Invoices
Members submit invoices for compensation for approval by a Compensation Panel. The invoice contains a statement of the work to be compensated which includes both Self-directed Work and any Directed Work that was used. Anyone can submit an invoice but generally it is the responsibility of the self-directed worker to prepare and submit the invoice. The amount of requested compensation is set by the self-directed worker along with a self-assigned number of hours of Directed Work to be associated with the compensation. There will be norms and guidelines for compensation pricing. In addition, a record of the hours of Directed Work used from the Directed Work Pool is recorded. Any dialog of statements from and between all workers related to the work being invoiced is also available on the invoice or otherwise made available to the Compensation Panel when reviewing the invoice.
	
### Pay Periods
Pay periods are set by the coop. Depending on the level of automation, pay periods could be every week, two weeks, or month. Work is paid based on the hours of Directed Work a member has performed. The pay rate is calculated either as the ratio of Directed Work to approved Self-directed Work assessment, or at an hourly rate agreed to by a self-directed worker and a directed worker. For example, suppose a member has been approved some self-directed work at 1000 RHOC at a 10 hour directed work tax rate. If this member has performed 10 hours of Directed Work, then the member will receive the full 1000 RHOC. If the member has performed less than 10 hours of Directed Work, say just 1 hours, then the member will be paid one tenth of 1000 or 100 RHOC with remaining balances of 900 RHOC and 9 hours of Directed Work. Members can also agree to be compensated for directed work at a given rate determined by the self-directed worker.

### Directed Work Balance
This is a member balance in hours of Directed Work that has been approved on an invoice but for which there is no associated Self-directed Work. The member can let this work accrue to some maximum determined by the board for future work that is self-directed. Or, the member can create an invoice for some or all of their Directed Work Balance and simply state a request of compensation. 
	
### Self-Directed Work Balance
The self-directed work balance is a balance of RHOC approved by a Compensation Panel but which there has not yet been a correlated amount of directed work. There is no obligation of the coop to ever pay a self-directed work balance. Self-directed work balances are an expedience used to approve invoices which would pay directed work. The member must perform the correlated directed work balance before receiving any payment for self-directed work.
	
### Unapproved Directed Work Balance
This is a balance of a member for the amount of hours of Directed Work they have used which has not been approved. Members performing directed work know that the coop is obliged to pay them for their directed work even if it is at the coop's established minimum rate so the coop sets a limit on how much unapproved work any self-directed worker is allowed to have.
	
### Rights and Obligations of Self-Directed Workers
Members performing self-directed work have these rights and obligations:
* Right to request work from the Directed Work Pool  
   Self-directed workers can create teams of other workers who are expected to follow their leadership. There could be some maximum budget placed on members which could be adjusted by approval of Compensation Panels. 
* Right to be the boss  
   Self-directed workers act as the boss when using work from the Directed Work Pool. Acting as the boss entitles the self-directed worker to ask any reasonable and lawful task of the directed workers. There need be no assumption that the tasks a self-directed worker assigns are ones the directed workers want to do, though, since directed workers have the right to refuse there needs to be a balance.
* Right of approval for directed work  
   It is the self-directed worker who approves any work provided by a directed worker. The directed worker can state how many hours of work they performed but the self-directed worker approves the work by listing it on their compensation invoice. The self-directed worker may choose to accept the directed worker's claim in full, in part, or not at all.
* Right to be heard  
   Self-directed workers have a right to comment on the work and it’s benefits to the coop, their choices and uses of work from the directed work pool, their request compensation and correlated directed work requirement.
* Obligation to obey the law  
   The self-directed worker must obey the law while exercising the right to be the boss. No directed workers should be harmed, discriminated against, abused, threatened, cheated, or otherwise treated in any way not consistent with (and hopefully better than) standard employment practices.
* Obligation to serve the coop  
   The self-directed worker must conduct their work in accordance with coop rules and must align their work to further the goals and needs of the coop.

### Rights and Obligations of Directed Workers
Members performing directed work have these rights and obligations:
* Right to decline work  
   Members are invited to perform directed work by self-directed workers which can be accepted or declined. Declining a work invitation may be recorded on a member's profile.
* Right to fair treatment  
   A member performing directed work has the right to fair treatment by the self-directed worker and any other directed workers.
* Right to compensation  
   A member performing directed work has a right to fair compensation. Compensation can be set through corresponding self-directed work or through an established default rate determined by the coop board. No directed work should go uncompensated.
* Right to be heard  
   Members have a right to be comment on their directed work how they were treated while performing the work.
* Obligation to subordination
   A member performing directed work is expected to work as a subordinate of the self-directed worker (within the law and within fair employment practice). The directed worker is expected to give of themselves fully to the work assigned by the self-directed worker, to advocate for the purpose and goals of the work, and be fully cooperate with a project team. This does not mean saying yes to everything the self-directed worker says, it means faithfully striving to achieve the goals set out by the self-directed worker.
* Obligation of availability  
   A member must maintain a calendar of available time for directed work. Norms of practice can emerge within the community as to how much lead time is customary when scheduling directed work. There should be no expectation for compensation for the time offered to the directed work pool, only work actively engaged in directed work is compensated.
* Obligation of compensation panel participation  
   Compensation panels are dynamically formed from the directed work pool. Members are expected to accept requests to participate on a compensation panel. Members will not, and cannot, serve on a panel judging their own work with as a self-directed work.
* Obligation to obey the law
   The directed worker must obey the law while working.
* Obligation to serve the coop
   The directed worker must conduct their work in accordance with coop rules and must align their work to further the goals and needs of the coop.
		
### Illustrative Example - A typical project
Alice is relatively new to RChain. She joined as a member a few months ago, went through the identification validation procedure and has been learning to program in Rholang and about the platform. 
	
Alice knew she wanted to contribute and be compensated so she created a profile and a calendar of availability in the directed work pool. She started with the default 10 hour maximum balance. Within days Alice was invited by Bob to work on his project. Alice accepted and worked for one day. 
	
Bob wanted more of Alice's work so he sponsored Alice with a proposal to increase her maximum directed work balance to 200 hours. A compensation panel reviewed the increase request. They looked at Alice's directed work pool profile, LinkedIn profile, and the recommendation from Bob who has completed many successful projects inside RChain. They voted and approved the increase in Alice's maximum directed work balance.
	
Alice continued working for a total of 100 hours on Bob's project. After two weeks, Bob prepared an invoice for approval by a compensation panel. On this invoice, Alice requested that 50 of the hours be compensated at $100 (RHOC equivalent) per hour and that the remaining 50 hours remain in her directed work balance. After working on Bob's project she got an idea for some additional functionality that she would like to lead and wants to save some directed work hours for her own project.
	
Bob's work was self-directed which involves a risk that it might not be paid. Bob feels he should be well compensated for taking the risk and leading an effort where his work might not be compensated because he knows only directed work is compensated. Bob thinks his work is worth at least $250 per hour so he asks for 15,000 RHOC at the normal 500 RHOC per hour directed work tax rate. This means that Bob will need to do 30 hours of directed work in order to receive his 15,000 RHOC. He has 20 hours in his directed work balance and figures his work on some coop committees over the next month will more than cover the remaining 10 hours.
	
The coop regularly forms compensation panels using a dynamic, random selection of members from the directed work pool as well as required members of the board or their appointees. A compensation panel of five members forms and reviews Bob's invoice. They look at the work his team has done, the leadership he's provided, the comments made by members of his team each stating that they've enjoyed their work on the project so far, have confidence in Bob's leadership and hope to continue the project. After some debate on whether the compensation rates are reasonable and after due diligence to confirm that the work fits the coops rules, goals, and meets applicable laws, the panel approves the invoice.
	
At the end of the month, coop members responsible for paying invoices collect the invoices which have been approved. For each member that has directed work hours on an approved invoice they determine the amount to pay and transfer the funds. Alice receives the RHOC equivalent of $5000 from her work on Bob's project and has another 50 hours in her directed work balance. Bob, has 20 of the required 30 hours of directed work balance so he is paid two thirds of the 15,000 RHOC approved and receives 10,000 RHOC with a remaining self-directed balance of 5000 RHOC and -10 directed work hours.
	
Alice continues working on Bob's project but decides to split her time on a project of her own. She's discussed this with Bob who agrees there wouldn't be any impact on his project. Bob likes Alice's idea and says that he could make time to do directed work on her project if she wished. Alice writes a project description, posts it to her GitHub account and visits the directed work pool to review profiles of available workers. She selects five workers and invites them and Bob to an initial project introduction meeting, offering them one hour of approved directed work for attending the meeting. Four of the five agree along with Bob so they meet over video chat and review the project.
	
Alice has only the default amount of 50 hours of directed work usage balance which she was awarded after being compensated for her first 100 hours of directed work. She knows she'll need more hours than that to make progress on the project so she prepares a petition to a compensation panel. On the petition she shares a description of the project as well as recommendations from Bob and the four other workers who are interested in working on the project.
	
The next compensation panel reviews Alice's petition for increased directed work usage. They approve her request for 1000 hours of unapproved directed work usage balance. With this approved, Alice begins work on her project with Bob and four other members. As work progresses, Alice prepares invoices for approval by compensation panels which are approved until Alice is finished with her project. Given that Alice has taken the risk of driving the project and not being fully paid, she asks for and receives a similar level of compensation as Bob did. As Alice meets her obligation of the corresponding directed work, some from her balance from Bob's project, and some from other work like working on compensation panels, Alice receives her full compensation request.
	
And so on, and so on, ..., and so on.
	
### Illustrative Example - Degenerate case, directed work not accepted
Alice has worked with RChain for nearly a year and has both lead and worked on many successful projects. Chad is a new member of RChain and has heard from a friend that it's easy to make quick money working on RChain projects and there's no formal hiring process. All he has to do is sign up.
	
Chad creates a profile in the directed work pool and states that he's nearly an expert in many areas and inflates his descriptions of his work history. Alice is looking for workers for her latest project and sees Chad's profile. Remembering how nice it was to be selected for a project when she was new to RChain she sends Chad an invite to join her project.
	
Chad enthusiastically agrees and says he can't wait to get started. Alice gives Chad some tasks which match his claims on his profile. Chad doesn't reply right away but after a couple days says he's working on them. Alice is a little concerned by Chad's slow response. She politely sends Chad a message saying that she knows he's new and is probably learning the ropes. She sends Chad a link to the rights and responsibilities of the directed workers. She also says she's not convinced that she would approve the last two days of work, if he were to claim any, unless he shares with her what he's done and gives an indication of what he'll get done in the days to come.
	
A few days go by and Alice hasn't heard from Chad. It's been a couple weeks since Alice submitted an invoice so she prepares one with her work, and her team members work including Chad, but she lists just one hour of approved work for Chad which accounts for time they spent discussing the project. The invoice is approved.
	
At the next pay day, Chad receives $20 for his one hour of approved work at the coop minimum wage. Chad is upset and writes angry messages in Discord and claims Alice was unfair to him. Members quickly chime in on Discord and say he should file a petition for a compensation panel. When the next panel is formed, they review Alice's invoice, her comments about Chad's work (or lack of) as well as Chad's notes on his petition. Chad claims that he worked for two weeks, full time, for 80 hours and wants at least the minimum of $1600 for his work. 
	
The panel members discuss and make proposals which outline different courses of action. One proposal is to pay the $1600 but ban Chad from working for at least one year. Another proposal suggests paying the average hourly rate of what other team members were paid for the one hour of work which Alice approved, for an additional $80. Another proposal suggests they do nothing but record the event on Chad's profile. 
	
The panel uses a quadratic voting scheme to vote on the proposals. All members accrue voice points by serving on panels or other governance work within the coop. Voice points are converted to votes by a square root ratio. That is, for one vote the member must spend one voice point. For two votes, four voice points. Casting three votes requires nine voice points, and so on. Each panel decision may require a certain number of votes to achieve a quorum but, in general, members are allowed to bank voice points, perhaps up to some maximum, for issues which they feel strongly about.
	
In this case, Chad might have a friend with a good reputation within the coop who wrote a post in Discord and commented on the invoice that argues in favor of Chad but agrees that he has some maturing to do. He says he'd like to work on projects with Chad in the future and thinks Chad can learn how to work well within the coop in the future.
	
This argument sways one member of the panel who decides to use sixteen voice points to cast four votes in favor of the proposal to do nothing but record the event on Chad's profile. That proposal wins and is the official decision of the panel.
