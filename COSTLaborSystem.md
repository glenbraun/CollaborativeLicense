# Cooperative Governance - Accepting Work and Compensation
The following cooperative governance system is based on the concept of a COST (Communal Ownership Self-assessed Tax) for labor described in the book "Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society" by Eric A. Posner &amp; E. Glen Weyl. 

The governance system below describes a system where work is accepted into a cooperative project and with what for compensation. It divides work into two types, creative work and supportive work. The compensation for creative work is set by the creative worker but is "taxed" by some amount of supportive work required to receive that compensation. The tax recognizes that creative work needs a context, a community to be aware of and receive its value. Supportive work establishes and maintains that context. 

To describe how the system works, the following terms are defined followed by descriptive scenarios which show them in action. The terms and scenarios are written from the perspective of using the system within the RChain cooperative, but would also apply to projects using the cooperative license.

## Terms of the Cooperative COST labor system
### Creative Work
Creative work is guided from an individual's inspiration. Some spark of imagination comes to a person which motivates them to take some action. Creative work can be done alone, but it often requires, or is benefited by, collaborative, cooperative support. Creative work asks to be seen, followed and supported, but that attention can draw a community away from other, potentially more beneficial, actions.

In the cooperative COST labor system, members initiate creative projects and solicit supportive participation from a pool of other members. The compensation amount for creative work is self-assessed but carries a tax of supportive work hours. The amount of supportive work hours is set by a compensation panel. All compensation for a project is paid by the cooperative based on the proportion of the corresponding supportive work accepted by other projects.

### Supportive Work
Supportive work is motivated by alignment with a shared vision. 

In the cooperative COST labor system, supportive work is requested and accepted through a project defined by another member's creative work. Acceptance of supportive work hours unlocks the worker's self-assessed compensation balance for payment.
	 
### Project Catalog
The project catalog is a database of projects. Each item in the catalog contains, at a minimum, a description of the project's creative vision, as well as a history of supportive work accepted by the project to date.
	 
### Member Profiles
Members maintain profiles which describes their skills, interests, and work history. Associated with each profile is an availability calendar which other members can use to solicit the member for supportive work on a creative project.

### Compensation Panels
Compensation panels are dynamically assembled groups of co-op members who review and pass judgement on compensation invoices. The panels are formed by selecting at least one board member and some number, perhaps two or four, members at random from the membership. These panels are formed to meet the demand of outstanding compensation invoices. Each panel uses a democratic process of quadratic voting to approve, reject, or amend compensation invoices. No member of a panel can review their own work.
	 
### Compensation Invoices
Members submit invoices for compensation for approval by a compensation panel. The invoice contains a statement of the work to be compensated which lists the project, its creator's self-assessed compensation, and any supportive work that was approved. 
	
### Pay Periods
At regular intervals, the co-op calculates the amount owed to each member for performing work. Work is paid based on the hours of supportive work a member has performed. 

### Supportive Work Balance
Each member has a balance, in hours, of supportive work that has been approved across all project invoices which has not been paid. The member can let this work accrue to some maximum determined by the board, or, because no supportive work can go unpaid, the member can create an invoice for some or all of their supportive work balance and state a request of compensation which is in line with the norms of payment of the cooperative.
	
### Self-assessed Balance
The self-assessed balance is a balance of RHOC approved by a compensation panel but which there has not yet been a correlated amount of supportive work. There is no obligation of the co-op to ever pay a self-assessed balance. The member must perform the correlated supportive work before receiving any payment.
	
### Unapproved Supportive Work Balance
This is a balance of a member for the amount of hours of supportive work they have used which has not been approved by a compensation panel. Members performing supportive work know that the co-op is obliged to pay them for their time even if it is at the co-op's established minimum rate, so the coop sets a maximum limit of supportive work any member is allowed to use.
	
### Rights and Obligations of Members when Performing Creative Work
Members performing creative work have these rights and obligations:
* Right to request work from other members  
   Members can create teams of other workers who are expected to align their work with the project vision.
* Right of approval for supportive work  
   The creative worker has the right to approve in full, in part, or not at all, any supportive work claimed to have been done by another member.
* Right to be heard  
   Self-directed workers have a right to comment on the work and it's benefits to the co-op, their choices and uses of supportive work, their justifications for their self-assessed compensation amount and its correlated supportive work requirement.
* Obligation to obey the law  
   All members must obey the law while exercising their rights as creative workers. No member shall be harmed, discriminated against, abused, threatened, cheated, or otherwise treated in any way not consistent with (and hopefully better than) standard employment practices.
* Obligation to serve the co-op  
   The work of all members must be conducted in accordance with coop rules and must be aligned with the goals and needs of the co-op.

### Rights and Obligations of Members when Performing Supportive Work
Members performing supportive work have these rights and obligations:
* Right to decline work  
   Members are invited to join projects to provide supportive work. Declining a work invitation may be recorded on a member's profile.
* Right to fair treatment  
   A member performing supportive work has the right to fair treatment by all project team members.
* Right to compensation  
   A member performing supportive work has a right to fair compensation. Compensation can be set through corresponding creative work or through an established default rate determined by the co-op board. No approved supportive work may go uncompensated.
* Right to be heard  
   Members have a right to comment on their supportive work to be considered by compensation panels.
* Obligation of alignment to project vision  
   A member performing supportive work is expected to align their work to promote the vision of the project. The member is expected to give of themselves fully to work requested by the project leadership, to advocate for the purpose and goals of the project, and be fully cooperative with a project team. This does not mean saying yes to everything. It means faithfully striving to support the project vision.
* Obligation of availability  
   A member must maintain a calendar of available time for supportive work. Norms of practice can emerge within the community as to how much lead time is customary when requesting supportive work. There should be no expectation for compensation for the time listed in the calendar of available time. Only work actively engaged in, and approved by, creative work projects is compensated.
* Obligation of compensation panel participation  
   Compensation panels are dynamically formed from the membership. Members are expected to accept requests to participate on compensation panels. Members will not, and cannot, serve on a panel judging their own work.
* Obligation to obey the law  
   All members must obey the law while exercising their rights as supportive workers. No member shall be harmed, discriminated against, abused, threatened, cheated, or otherwise treated in any way not consistent with (and hopefully better than) standard employment practices.
* Obligation to serve the co-op  
   The work of all members must be conducted in accordance with coop rules and must be aligned with the goals and needs of the co-op.
		
### Illustrative Example - A typical project
Alice is relatively new to RChain. She joined as a member a few months ago, went through the identification validation procedure and has been learning about the platform and how to program in Rholang. 
	
Alice knew she wanted to contribute and be compensated so she created a profile and a calendar of availability. Like all members, she started with a maximum supportive work balance of 10 hours. Within days, Alice was invited by Bob to work on his project. Alice accepted and worked for one day. 
	
Bob wanted more of Alice's work so he sponsored Alice with a proposal to increase her maximum supportive work balance to 200 hours. A compensation panel reviewed the increase request. They looked at Alice's member profile and the recommendation from Bob who has completed many successful projects inside RChain. They voted and approved the increase.
	
Alice continued working for a total of 100 hours on Bob's project. After two weeks, Bob prepared an invoice for approval by a compensation panel. On this invoice, Alice requested that 50 of the hours be compensated at $100 (RHOC equivalent) per hour and that the remaining 50 hours remain in her supportive work balance. After working on Bob's project she got an idea for some additional functionality that she would like to lead and wants to save some supportive work hours to be paid to her later for her own project.
	
Bob's work was self-directed which involves a risk that it might not be paid. Bob feels he should be well compensated for taking the risk and leading an effort where his work might not be compensated because he knows only supportive work is compensated. Bob thinks his work is worth at least $250 per hour so he asks for 15,000 RHOC at the normal 500 RHOC per hour supportive work tax rate. This means that Bob will need to do 30 hours of supportive work in order to receive his 15,000 RHOC. He has 20 hours in his supportive work balance and figures his work on some co-op committees over the next month will more than cover the remaining 10 hours.
	
The co-op regularly forms compensation panels using a dynamic, random selection of the membership as well as required members of the board or their appointees. A compensation panel of five members forms and reviews Bob's invoice. They look at the work his team has done, the leadership he's provided, the comments made by members of his team each stating that they've enjoyed their work on the project so far, have confidence in Bob's leadership and hope to continue the project. After some debate on whether the compensation rates are reasonable and after due diligence to confirm that the work fits the co-op's rules and goals and meets applicable laws, the panel approves the invoice.
	
At the end of the month, co-op members responsible for paying invoices collect the invoices which have been approved. For each member that has supportive work hours on an approved invoice they determine the amount to pay and transfer the funds. Alice receives the RHOC equivalent of $5000 from her work on Bob's project and has another 50 hours in her supportive work balance. Bob, has 20 of the required 30 hours of supportive work balance so he is paid two thirds of the 15,000 RHOC approved and receives 10,000 RHOC with a remaining balance of 5000 RHOC and -10 supportive work hours.
	
Alice continues working on Bob's project but decides to split her time on a project of her own. She discusses this with Bob, who agrees there wouldn't be any impact on his project. Bob likes Alice's idea and says that he could make time to do supportive work on her project if she wished. Alice writes a project description, posts it to her GitHub account and browses member profiles and their availability calendar to find supportive workers. She thinks, wouldn't be cool if some big data, recommender system could help her find workers? Maybe someday she'll start a project like that. But, until such a recommender system exists, Alice selects five workers and invites them and Bob to an initial project introduction meeting, offering them one hour of approved supportive work for attending the meeting. Four of the five agree along with Bob so they meet over video chat and review the project.
	
Alice has only the default amount of 50 hours of supportive work usage balance which she was awarded after being compensated for her first 100 hours of supportive work. She knows she'll need more hours than that to make progress on the project so she prepares a petition to a compensation panel. On the petition she shares a description of the project as well as recommendations from Bob and the four other workers who are interested in working on the project.
	
The next compensation panel reviews Alice's petition for increased supportive work usage. They approve her request for 1000 hours of unapproved supportive work usage balance. With this approved, Alice begins work on her project with Bob and four other members. As work progresses, Alice prepares invoices for approval by compensation panels which are approved until Alice is finished with her project. Given that Alice has taken the risk of driving the project and not being fully paid, she asks for and receives a similar level of compensation as Bob did. As Alice meets her obligation of the corresponding supportive work, some from her balance from Bob's project, and some from other work like working on compensation panels, Alice receives her full compensation request.
	
And so on, and so on, ..., and so on.
	
### Illustrative Example - Degenerate case, directed work not accepted
Alice has worked with RChain for nearly a year and has both lead and worked on many successful projects. Chad is a new member of RChain and has heard from a friend that it's easy to make quick money working on RChain projects and there's no formal hiring process. All he has to do is sign up.
	
Chad creates a member profile where he states that he's nearly an expert in many areas and inflates his descriptions of his work history. Alice is looking for workers for her latest project and sees Chad's profile. Remembering how nice it was to be selected for a project when she was new to RChain, she sends Chad an invite to join her project.
	
Chad enthusiastically agrees and says he can't wait to get started. Alice gives Chad some tasks which match his claims on his profile. Chad doesn't reply right away but after a couple days says he's working on them. Alice is a little concerned by Chad's slow response. She politely sends Chad a message saying that she knows he's new and is probably learning the ropes. She sends Chad a link to the rights and responsibilities of the supportive work. She also says she's not convinced that she would approve the last two days of work, if he were to claim any, unless he shares with her what he's done and gives an indication of what he'll get done in the days to come.
	
A few days go by and Alice hasn't heard from Chad. It's been a couple weeks since Alice submitted an invoice so she prepares one with her work, and her team members' work including Chad, but she lists just one hour of approved work for Chad which accounts for time they spent discussing the project. The invoice is approved.
	
At the next pay day, Chad receives $20 for his one hour of approved work at the co-op minimum wage. Chad is upset and writes angry messages in Discord and claims Alice was unfair to him. Members quickly chime in on Discord and say he should file a petition for a compensation panel. When the next panel is formed, they review Alice's invoice, her comments about Chad's work (or lack thereof), as well as Chad's notes on his petition. Chad claims that he worked for two weeks, full time, for 80 hours and wants at least the minimum of $1600 for his work. 
	
The panel members discuss and make proposals which outline different courses of action. One proposal is to pay the $1600 but ban Chad from working for at least one year. Another proposal suggests paying the average hourly rate of what other team members were paid for the one hour of work which Alice approved, for an additional $80. Another proposal suggests they do nothing but record the event on Chad's profile. 
	
The panel uses a quadratic voting scheme to vote on the proposals. All members accrue voice points by serving on panels or other governance work within the coop. Voice points are converted to votes by a square root ratio. That is, for one vote the member must spend one voice point. For two votes, four voice points. Casting three votes requires nine voice points, and so on. Each panel decision may require a certain number of votes to achieve a quorum but, in general, members are allowed to bank voice points, perhaps up to some maximum, for issues which they feel strongly about.
	
In this case, Chad might have a friend with a good reputation within the co-op who wrote a post in Discord and commented on the invoice that argues in favor of Chad but agrees that he has some maturing to do. He says he'd like to work on projects with Chad in the future and thinks Chad can learn how to work well within the co-op in time.
	
This argument sways one member of the panel who decides to use sixteen voice points to cast four votes in favor of the proposal to do nothing but record the event on Chad's profile. That proposal wins and is the official decision of the panel.
